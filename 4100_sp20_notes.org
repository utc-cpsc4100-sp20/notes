* Languages
** C
   - originally 1973
   - Dennis Ritchie (The R in K&R)
   - ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C standard since 1989
   - imperative: statements affect program state
   - structured: formal control structures / blocks
   - procedural: code organized into called procedures (subroutines)
   - static typing: data type property assigned at compile time
   - weakly typed (=void*=) : implicit type casting under some conditions
   - compiles all the way to the hardware (executables not portable)
   - allows for raw memory management and manipulation

   - modeled naturally on the standard /von Neumann machine/ architecture
     - CPU with registers, ALU, control unit
     - memory containing both instructions and data
